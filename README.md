- [Ark](https://github.com/spargle/ark) - Ark is a tiny, fast, and **somewhat** useful programming language focused on runtime stability and simple code syntax. Every instruction is a single character, but it is NOT an esolang. (anymore)
- [ArkScript](https://arkscript-lang.dev) - ArkScript is a small, fast, functional and scripting language for C++ projects ; the syntax is inspired by Lisp. It's a scripting language aiming for high portability and easily embedding in C++ projects, with a few nice features such as tail call optimization and macros.
- [Arturo](https://github.com/arturo-lang/arturo) - Arturo is an independently-developed, modern programming language, vaguely related to various other ones - including but not limited to Logo, Rebol, Forth, Ruby, Haskell, D, SmallTalk, Tcl, and Lisp. The language has been designed following some very simple and straightforward principles: a) Code is just a list of words and symbols, b) Words and symbols within a block are interpreted - when needed - according to the context, c) No reserved words or keywords - look for them as hard as you can; there are absolutely none
# B (3):
- [Beads](http://beadslang.org/) - The Beads project is a daring attempt to generate a new language that will replace the current popular toolchain stack of HTML/CSS/JS/+Frameworks+Database, with a single language.
